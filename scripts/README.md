# Scripts Folder

The `scripts` folder contains a comprehensive set of Python scripts designed to support various stages of the computational docking workflow. These scripts facilitate key processes such as data preparation, file format conversion, protein-ligand alignment, and post-docking analysis.

Each script is modular and can be executed independently or integrated into larger pipelines, providing flexibility for a range of computational tasks. This structured approach ensures efficiency, consistency, and scalability, making the scripts suitable for both small-scale studies and high-throughput docking projects.
