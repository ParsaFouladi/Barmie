# Scripts Folder

The `scripts` folder contains a comprehensive set of Python scripts designed to support various stages of the computational docking workflow. These scripts facilitate key processes such as data preparation, file format conversion, protein-ligand alignment, and post-docking analysis.

Each script is modular and can be executed independently or integrated into larger pipelines, providing flexibility for a range of computational tasks. This structured approach ensures efficiency, consistency, and scalability, making the scripts suitable for both small-scale studies and high-throughput docking projects.

## File Conversion Scripts

The folder includes several scripts dedicated to converting molecular file formats, essential for preparing data for docking and analysis. These conversion scripts cover common formats such as PDB, PDBQT, MOL2, and SDF.

### Available Conversion Scripts:
- `pdb_to_pdbqt.py` - Converts PDB files to PDBQT format.
- `pdbqt_to_mol2.py` - Converts PDBQT files to MOL2 format.
- `pdbqt_to_pdb.py` - Converts PDBQT files back to PDB format.
- `sdf_to_pdbqt.py` - Converts SDF files to PDBQT format.

### Usage
All file conversion scripts follow the same command-line structure for consistency:

```bash
python from_to.py input_folder output_folder
```

## Protein Alignment Script

The `alignment.py` script is designed to align multiple protein structures to a reference protein using PyMOLâ€™s structural alignment capabilities. This is particularly useful when preparing proteins for docking or structural comparison studies.

### Features:
- Aligns multiple proteins to a specified reference structure.
- Outputs aligned structures in PDB format for downstream analysis.

### Requirements:
- **PyMOL** must be installed and accessible within your Python environment.

### Usage:
```bash
python alignment.py input_folder output_folder reference_protein.pdb
```

- **`input_folder`**: Folder containing the protein files to be aligned.
- **`output_folder`**: Destination folder where the aligned files will be saved.
- **`reference_protein.pdb`**: The reference protein structure to which all other proteins will be aligned.

This command will align all proteins in the `./proteins` folder to `reference.pdb` and save the aligned structures in the `./aligned_proteins` folder.

**Note:** Ensure that **PyMOL** is correctly installed in your Python environment to run this script successfully. Without PyMOL, the alignment functionalities will not work.

# Binding Pocket Filtering Script

The `filter_pocket.py` script is designed to identify and extract binding pockets from protein structures. This script helps refine the protein structure for docking studies by focusing on specific binding regions.

### Features:
- Identifies binding pockets based on user-defined parameters.
- Filters atoms based on proximity to the binding site and B-factor thresholds.
- Logs processing status for each file.

### Requirements:
- **Biopython** must be installed to run this script successfully.

### Usage:
```bash
python filter_pocket.py input_folder output_folder pocket_name num_atoms_before
```

- **`input_folder`**: Folder containing the PDB files to be processed.
- **`output_folder`**: Destination folder where the filtered structures will be saved.
- **`pocket_name`**: The identifier for the binding pocket you want to target.
- **`num_atoms_before`**: The number of atoms to consider around the binding pocket for filtering.

This command will process all `.pdb` files in the `./proteins` folder, filter the structures based on the `KAIEP` pocket, and save the results in the `./filtered_proteins` folder.
